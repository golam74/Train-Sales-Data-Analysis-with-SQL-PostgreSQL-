# 🛒 Retail Train Sales Data Analysis with SQL (PostgreSQL)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end SQL analytics** on a retail sales dataset using PostgreSQL.  
The dataset contains **20,000+ rows** of sales transactions with features like:  

- Date, Day of Week, Holiday Indicator  
- Category, Brand  
- Past Purchase Trends  
- Price, Discount, Competitor Price  
- Sales Quantity  

The goal is to solve **real-world business questions** using SQL, from **basic aggregations** to **advanced analytics with window functions and correlations**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Compare holiday vs non-holiday sales performance  
✔ Identify impact of discounts on sales quantity  
✔ Analyze competitor pricing vs our product pricing  
✔ Rank brands by revenue and sales performance  
✔ Detect sales trends using `LAG()` and moving averages  
✔ Explore correlation between price, discount, and sales

## ⚡ SQL Concepts Covered
- Basic Queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`  
- Conditional Logic: `CASE WHEN`  
- Window Functions: `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `OVER()`  
- Statistical Functions: `CORR()` for correlation analysis  
- Data Bucketing: discount ranges, competitor comparison
